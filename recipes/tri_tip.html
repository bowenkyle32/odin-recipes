    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The tri-tip is a triangular cut of beef from the bottom sirloin subprimal cut, consisting of the tensor fasciae latae muscle. 
        Untrimmed, the tri-tip weighs around 5 pounds. In the US, the tri-tip is taken from NAMP cut 185C.
        The precise origin of the name "tri-tip" for this cut of beef is unclear, with several sources claiming original 
        usage of the term. This cut of beef has been referred to by a variety of names 
        including "Newport steak”,"Santa Maria steak”, "triangle tip”, and "triangle steak”.
        The cut was known in the United States as early as 1915, called "the triangle part" of the loin butt. 
        Rondo (Ron) Brough, a butcher for the U.S. Army during World War II working in Southern California, 
        claimed that he created the "triangle tip" cut as a way to gain an extra portion of meat for the troops by 
        reorienting nearby cuts and eliminating scrap. This practice caught on with Brough's Army colleagues and after the War, 
        they began cutting and serving triangle tip throughout restaurants and butcher shops in California.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (about 2 1/2-pound) beef tri-tip roast </li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>   
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons granulated garlic</li> 
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil</li>  
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir 1 1/2 teaspoons granulated garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, and 1 1/2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper 
            together in a small bowl. Pat 1 (about 2 1/2-pound) beef tri-tip roast dry with paper towels. 
            If there is any silver skin on the surface, trim it off. Rub all over with the garlic mixture. 
            The tri-tip can be cooked immediately or transferred to a plate and refrigerated uncovered for up to 8 hours.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large oven-safe or cast iron frying pan (at least 12 inches wide) 
            over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the tri-tip smoother-side down and press down on it briefly so it has good
             contact with the pan. Cook undisturbed until well-browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Flip the tri-tip.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pan to the oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest 
            part of the tri-tip registers about 125ºF for medium, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
