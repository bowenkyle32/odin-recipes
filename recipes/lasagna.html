    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. 
        Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù 
        (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings 
        and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil.The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which
         becomes melted after baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. 
         The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square portions.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups </li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>   
        <li>¾ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li> 
        <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>  
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li> ¼ tsp pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong> Combine the cheese filling ingredients</strong> in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong> Heat olive oil </strong> over medium heat and <strong> add the diced onions </strong>. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
        <li><strong>Add the ground beef and sausage </strong>and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°</li>
        <li><strong>Bake for 30 minutes</strong>. Remove cover and bake for 15 more minutes. If desired, broil at 450° to brown the top more, watch it carefully during this time</li>
    </ol>
