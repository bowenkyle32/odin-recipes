    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The <strong>chile relleno</strong>  is a dish in Mexican cuisine that originated in the city of Puebla. 
        In 1858, it was described as a "green chile pepper stuffed with minced meat and coated with eggs".
        The most common pepper used is Puebla's poblano pepper, though New Mexico chile, pasilla, or even 
        jalapeño peppers are popular as well. It is typically stuffed with melted cheese, such as queso Chihuahua 
        or queso Oaxaca or with picadillo meat made of diced pork, raisins and nuts, seasoned with canella; covered 
        in an egg white batter, simply corn masa flour and fried, or without any batter at all. Although it is often 
        served in a tomato sauce, the sauces can vary.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large poblano peppers</li>
        <li>8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>4 cups oil</li>   
        <li>3 large eggs</li> 
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>  
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong> Roast the peppers:</strong> Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil and place poblano peppers on top. 
            Set your oven rack directly underneath the broiler and turn the broiler on.</li>
        <li><strong> Broil poblanos </strong> for 5 minutes, or until the skin is blackened and blistered. Carefully flip them
             over and broil for another 5 minutes, or until the skin is blackened and blistered.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the chile rellenos: </strong> Fry the peppers for 3-5 minutes per side, until the batter is golden brown
             and crispy. Try not to overcrowd the peppers in the pan</li>
        <li><strong>Serve: </strong>Immediately serve chile rellenos on a plate with some salsa, freshly chopped cilantro 
            and some cotija cheese</li>
    </ol>
